# pyhandouter
Neat little python script to make ppt like handouts from pdf's

To use it, simply follow the instructions in the script. It's recomended to use the Handouter_portable.py, put all the files you want to process in a single folder (directory) and process them together.
For ease, you can also put your python file into that directory and use relative paths if you plan to generate multiple handouts.

**please note**<br>
  -all the pdf's you give are alphabetically sorted and one single combined file is created.<br>
  -at the moment the script is only inserting slides with lines between the original slides. When you print you can use the "print 6 pages per sheet" option to get the expected result. I will add this option to the script in the future.
